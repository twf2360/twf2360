<h2>About Me:</h2>
I'm Tom. I'm a lover of fantasy books, of endurance sports, and of music. I'm ~technically speaking~ a Master of Physics (I graduated with a Physics Masters degree). I like to keep a record of my life, and recently have started blogging to supplement that. As a firm believer in the fact that you don't have to excel at your hobbies, I'm an average triathlete, a mediocore tennis player, and a supbar blogger. But I'm pretty fantastic at reading books and listening to music so there is that. Programming is something I picked up throughout my degree - and something I really enjoyed. So much so that I have persued a career in Software Development! I'm very much at the beginning of the road, starting as a Capital One Software Academy Graduate in September 2022. But I also do some programming for fun, as I will hopefully continue to document here. Cheers!
